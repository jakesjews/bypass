Use PROGRESS.md as the source of truth.

We are continuing from a previous session.
Immediate goal: Ship end-to-end demo: paste synthetic note → draft order resources (MedicationRequest/ServiceRequest) → basic review/export.

Blockers: Output still charting-centric; no draft order resources; review/edit/export UI missing; intake depends on seeded questionnaire/bot config.
